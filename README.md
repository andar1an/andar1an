- 👋 Hi, I’m @andar1an
- 💞️ I am building a Social Music Discovery App! As part of that journey I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I love and that align with my dev journey based on building a PWA with WASM and Rust.

NOTE: My personal repos are being migrated to a self-hosted solution. I will update this readme with a link once migration is complete. 

Community Collaboration:
- Codeberg: [personal](https://codeberg.org/andar1an)
- Github: [personal](https://github.com/andar1an)
- Gitlab: [personal](https://gitlab.com/users/andar1an)

Personal and Organization Repositories
- Selfhosted (Closed Source) - Raw Git or Forgejo or Gitea: TBD [personal](), [jammin]()
- Codeberg (OSS ONLY): [personal](https://codeberg.org/andar1an), [jammin oss repo_mirror and discovery](https://codeberg.org/jammin)
- Github: [jammin oss repo mirror and discovery](https://github.com/jamminmusic)
- Gitlab: TBD [jammin oss repo mirror and discovery]()
