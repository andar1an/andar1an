ðŸ‘‹, I'm @andar1an, a rustacean ðŸ¦€

I'm working towards Social Music Discovery innovation - <https://jamminmusic.com>

I'm passionate about too many things, and occasionaly write about those things when the mood strikes - <https://theandar1an.com>

I use forks on Github as an archive tool to track projects I like. They are portable - unlike stars - and I can back up the projects regularly, as well as contibute on occasion.

My personal code will not be available on this platform.
